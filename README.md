## Key Features

1. **Global Summary Metrics**:
   - **Partially Vaccinated Population**: 3,83,83,52,700 people.
   - **Fully Vaccinated Population**: 2,94,07,74,429 people.
   - **Unvaccinated Population Share**: 51.26% of the global population.

2. **Comparative Vaccination Rates by Country**:
   - Horizontal bar charts visualize the share of people vaccinated (fully or partially) by country.
   - Top-performing countries include:
     - **Gibraltar**: 100% Fully Vaccinated.
     - **United Arab Emirates**: 100% Fully Vaccinated.
     - **Portugal**: 88.47% Fully Vaccinated.

3. **Geographic Representation**:
   - A world map displaying vaccination rates per hundred by country.
   - Intensity of color reflects vaccination coverage, highlighting geographic disparities.

4. **Economic Influence on Vaccination**:
   - A scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between GDP per capita and vaccination rates.
   - Key Observations:
     - Wealthy nations like Qatar, Singapore, and Luxembourg exhibit high vaccination rates.
     - Countries with lower GDP, such as Gabon and Iraq, show lower vaccination coverage.

## Key Insights

1. **Global Vaccination Status**:
   - While a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, over half (51.26%) remains unvaccinated, indicating logistical or resource-related challenges.

2. **Regional Disparities**:
   - High-performing countries like Gibraltar and the UAE demonstrate successful vaccination campaigns.
   - Countries with limited resources face slower progress, emphasizing the need for equitable vaccine distribution.

3. **Economic Correlation**:
   - GDP per capita strongly correlates with vaccination rates, highlighting the role of economic factors in vaccine accessibility.

4. **Geographic Trends**:
   - Maps reveal clusters of high vaccination in economically stable regions and low coverage in less-developed areas.

   - Interactive filters for **Country**, **Continent**, and custom date ranges enable dynamic exploration of data.

2. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
   - Centralized metrics highlight the global vaccination status at a glance.

3. **Bar Chart**:
   - Comparative analysis of vaccination rates across countries.

4. **World Map**:
   - Visualizes vaccination rates geographically for quick identification of disparities.

5. **Scatter Plot**:
   - Illustrates the relationship between economic strength (GDP per capita) and vaccination rates.
